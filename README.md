# hello-world
Hello everybody!
I'm Jane and I'm excited to share my projects with the world! I am a freshman computer science major at the University of Texas at Dallas, my favorite color is red (scarlet to be exact), and I enjoy a variety of activities: playing the violin, painting, photography, and coding!
